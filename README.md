# fraction-grid

Update the variables at the top of the _grid.scss file to configure your grid system.

`$columnsList` 
A list of the column sizes you'd like. If you only want a 12-column grid, you'd just use
`$columnsList: '12'`. To add a 5-column option, you'd change it to `$columnsList: '12, 5'`

Then, `cd` into the fraction-grid directory and run `npm install` and then `grunt` to build your CSS.
